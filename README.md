A deep learning project demonstrating digit classification on the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and Keras. Designed for beginners and intermediate developers to understand neural network training, evaluation, and deployment workflows with Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

## üéØ Purpose
This project showcases a practical approach to computer vision classification tasks with:

- Modern TensorFlow/Keras API usage

- End-to-end experimentation (exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and results)

- Reproducible code for educational and portfolio purposes

## ‚ú® Features
### Core Functionality
üî¢ Digit Recognition: Classifies hand-written digits (0‚Äì9) from pixel images

üìà Model Training & Evaluation: Tracks accuracy/loss through epochs, with clear results

üìä Visualization: Live plots of accuracy, loss, and training history (via Matplotlib)

üóÇ Data Preprocessing: Automated normalization/scaling for better convergence

üì§ Prediction Examples: Predicts sample digit images and shows output visually

### Technical Highlights
‚òëÔ∏è Sequential Keras Model: Simple, readable neural network architecture (Flatten, Dense layers)

‚ö° Fast Model Fit: ~98% accuracy after just a few epochs

üîÑ Validation Split: Monitors model generalization and prevents overfitting

‚úÖ Error Handling: Catches & explains input and dataset errors

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- Language: Python 3.8+

- Frameworks: TensorFlow 2.x, Keras

- Notebook: Jupyter Notebook

- Libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib

- Dataset: MNIST (from TensorFlow/Keras API)

- Platform: Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows)

## üöÄ Getting Started
